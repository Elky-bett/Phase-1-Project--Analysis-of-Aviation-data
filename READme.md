# Project Title

Aviation Incident Analysis: Key Insights for Safer Operations

## Overview
In this project I will analyze accident data to identify low‑risk aircraft types and provide business recommendations that guide investment decisions. This will provide the organization and investors with information to enter the aviation industry.

## Data Understanding and Analysis

### Data Preparation- Exploratory data analysis
    - Deleted one column
    - Deleted duplicate data
    - new index set
    - renamed 4 columns
    - changed crush_date and fatalities column datatypes

### Data analysis
The data anysis used comprised the fo
- Column Chart of Top 5 Most Common Aircraft Types
- Column Chart of Fatalities by Operator
- Bar Chart of Damage Classification Distribution

### Data visualization
The following visualizations were done:
    - Barchart of top 5 Most Common Aircraft Types 
    - Bar chart of fatalities by Operator
    - line chart of accident frequency overtime
    - damage clasification distribution
    - Fatal vs. non‑fatal accidents
    - Top accident locations
    
## Conclusion
    - The top 5 most common aircraft types dominate the dataset, suggesting that incident reporting is concentrated among widely used models. 
    - A small number of operators account for disproportionately high fatalities
    - The majority of incidents fall under Write-Off and Substantial damage categories, while Minor and No Damage are relatively rare. The presence of missing/unknown entries highlights gaps in reporting consistency and data quality.

## Recommendations
    - There is need for deeper analysis on the top 5 aircraft types to identify whether their high incident counts are purely due to usage volume or linked to specific safety vulnerabilities.
    - Strengthen reporting standards to minimize “Unknown” or “Missing” classifications.
    - Extend the study to temporal trends (accident dates) and geographic distribution (locations) to uncover patterns that could inform preventive measures
